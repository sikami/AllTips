DOCKER

==================
Dockerfile (needs to be created yourself in text editor)
==================
FROM [os]:[version]
RUN apt-get -y update (updates everything)
RUN apt-get -y install [image name can be found on Docker Hub]
EXPOSE 80 (port that is docker listening from)
CMD [apachectl] -D FOREGROUND (running the program)

===============
Build the docker
===============
run this on the cli:
$ sudo docker build -t [name has to be lowercase; eg: customer_image] . (it needs the dot)

==============
Docker command
==============
$sudo docker images (it will list all the images stored in local)
$sudo docker ps (checks what images is running)
$sudo docker stop [container id]

==============
Troubleshoot
==============
1. If this command appears: 
AH0558: apache2: Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualifed domain name, using 172.17.02 Set the 'ServerName' directive globally to surpress this message.
(this is because in CMD up there, we specify apache to run in foreground mode, it has to run directly)

solution:

1. detach the image with:
$sudo docker run -dit -p 80:80 [name of image]
-p : port 80 in our local map it to docker which is on 80

check if image is running and run it by typing localhost in the we browser, if its a web development image

HOW TO SETUP GITLAB-RUNNER MANUALLY
===================================
1. for Help
sudo gitlab-runner --help
2. Register the runner
sudo gitlab-runner register
-- then enter url cordinator setup (can be found on gitlab runner page in gitlab under setup specific runner manually)
-- then enter the token (can be found on gitlab runner page in gitlab under setup specific runner manually)
-- then just type description for the runner (up to you)
-- then enter tags for the runner (IMPORTANT!!) (needs to be the same as the tags in the yml file, if the stage is build, test, deploy)
$stage, build, test, deploy, qa
-- then there will be question for if you want run the build that is untagged, just press enter
-- then there is question if we want to lock the runner to the project we are running, just press enter
-- then enter the executor: up to you (but in the example it runs shell exec)
